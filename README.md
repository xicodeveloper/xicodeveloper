Hi, I’m @xicodeveloper, a developer enthusiast!
 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what can be created with code.
 I’m currently learning about the latest advancements in web development, machine learning, and cloud computing.
 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source projects or anything related to innovative software development.
 You can reach me through my GitHub profile or drop me a message at forofrancisco4@gmail.com.

 Fun fact: I once built a chatbot that could speak in emoji and tell jokes.
